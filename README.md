### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### in short, I'm a fresher in the field of information technology, but being a loving to read lifelong learner and a resourceful person has made me rather skilled at breaking new grounds. That being said, having learned a bit about Python and backend in general as well as getting to know the agile methodology in finding bugs satisfied my innate inquisitiveness, which manifests itself in a keen eye for detail. I'm also more than skilled at lateral thinking and have a knack for coming up with unorthodox solutions. I am well versed in building computers and know my hardware well, so I came to a thought it is time to get to know the ins and outs of the software installed on it, explore its implementation process.
### Further into my personality, I'm an open-minded person with great enthusiasm for learning new technologies and searching for the most reasonable solutions. I make my mark by having a different approach to many things though, which is not always met with appreciation, but that's how I am. Hope it will come in handy!
### When all was said and done I might just add I'm really into world of fantasy and science fiction, which I love to read about, especially in English, which adds a lot of charm to it. I also reckon the ground of psychology to be an extremely fascinating, thus worth exploring.
